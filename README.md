Heart Attack Prediction

#**Introduction**
Good data-driven systems for predicting cardiac illnesses can help to enhance the overall research and preventive process, allowing more individuals to live a healthy lifestyle. A heart attack happens when a part of the heart muscle doesn't get enough blood. The more time that passes without treatment to restore blood from, the greater the damage to the heart muscle. This is where Machine Learning enters the picture. Machine Learning aids in the prognosis of heart illnesses, and the results are fairly precise.
